## What is ML

> Machine learning is a subfield of <span class="fragment highlight-red">AI</span> that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. <br>
> <span class="fragment highlight-current-green">In other words, machine learning allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. </span>

### Some Concepts

#### Classification

> Classification is a technique used for categorizing data into <span class="fragment highlight-red">predefined classes </span> or labels based on input features

#### Clustering

> Clustering is a technique used for <span class="fragment highlight-red">grouping similar data points together </span>based on their inherent similarities
